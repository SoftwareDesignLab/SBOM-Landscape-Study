# SBOM-Landscape-Study
This repo accumulate underlying data and analysis results for assessing the current landscape of open-source and proprietary tools related to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). We investigate emerging use cases in software supply chain security and identify gaps in SBOM technologies. Our current analysis encompasses 84 tools, providing a snapshot of the current market and highlighting areas for improvement.
